-- keep settings and values requiring initialization before your application
-- starts running, such as database connections. Every handler will have
-- access to the data present here.

-- Note that this is really half the story; in Application.hs, mkYesodDispatch
-- generates the rest of the code. Please see the following documentation
-- for an explanation for this split:

-- This function also generates the following type synonyms:
-- type Handler = HandlerT App IO
-- type Widget = WidgetT App IO ()
mkYesodData "App" $(parseRoutesFile "config/routes")

-- | A convenient synonym for creating forms.
type Form x = Html -> MForm (HandlerFor App) (FormResult x, Widget)

-- | A convenient synonym for database access functions.
type DB a = forall (m :: * -> *).
    (MonadUnliftIO m) => ReaderT SqlBackend m a

-- Useful when writing code that is re-usable outside of the Handler context.
-- An example is background jobs that send email.
-- This can also be useful for writing code that works across multiple Yesod applications.
