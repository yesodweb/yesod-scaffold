     <h1>Welcome to Yesod!
     <p>By default it uses bootstrap 3

<div .list-group>
  <span .list-group-item>
     Now that you have a working project you should use the
     <a href=http://www.yesodweb.com/book/>
       Yesod book <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book"></span>
     to learn more.
     You can also use this scaffolded site to explore some basic concepts.

  <span .list-group-item>
     This page was generated by the <tt>#{handlerName}</tt> handler in
     <tt>Handler/Home.hs</tt>.

  <span .list-group-item>
     The <tt>#{handlerName}</tt> handler is set to generate your
     site's home screen in Routes file
     <tt>config/routes

  <span .list-group-item>
     The HTML you are seeing now is actually composed by a number of <em>widgets</em>, #
     most of them are brought together by the <tt>defaultLayout</tt> function which #
     is defined in the <tt>Foundation.hs</tt> module, and used by <tt>#{handlerName}</tt>. #
     All the files for templates and wigdets are in <tt>templates</tt>.

  <span .list-group-item>
    A Widget's Html, Css and Javascript are separated in three files with the
    <tt>.hamlet</tt>, <tt>.lucius</tt> and <tt>.julius</tt> extensions.

  <span .list-group-item ##{aDomId}>
     If you had javascript enabled then you wouldn't be seeing this.

<div .page-header><h2>Forms

<div>
    This is an example trivial Form. Read the
    <a href="http://www.yesodweb.com/book/forms">Forms chapter<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a> #
    on the yesod book to learn more about them.
    $maybe (info,con) <- submission
      <div .message .alert .alert-success>
        Your file's type was <em>#{fileContentType info}</em>. You say it has: <em>#{con}</em>
    <form method=post action=@{HomeR}#form enctype=#{formEnctype}>
      ^{formWidget}
      <button .btn .btn-primary type="submit">
         Send it! <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-upload"></span>

<div .page-header><h2>Testing

<div>
     And last but not least, Testing. In <tt>test/Spec.hs</tt> you will find a #
     test suite that performs tests on this page. #
     You can run your tests by doing: <pre>yesod test</pre>
